_Live, from Santa Barbara, California. I waited until the last minute on this one. I hope it works for you._

**Eleventy v3.0.0: Possums ❤️ ESM.** While this is not likely news to many of you, Eleventy v3.0.0 has been released. This is a major release with a lot of new features and changes. If you haven't already, check out the [release notes](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0). And if you need help upgrading, there's the [eleventy-upgrade-help plugin](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help). And there's an [Upgrading category](/categories/upgrading/) on this site to see how others have upgraded their sites.

**Images for v3.** To go along with v3, there's also [Eleventy Image v5.0.0](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img/releases/tag/v5.0.0) to go with it. Just one of the highlights is the [optimize on request feature](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#optimize-images-on-request) is great for those sites with a lot of images as it allows you to speed up local development by deferring optimization until the image is requested by the browser.

**Starters go v3.** The site you are now on is running v3 as are some of the starters on the [Starters page](/starters/). As of this writing, the top five on that list are running v3. They include the [eleventy base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), Lene Saile's [eleventy-excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent), and Adam Stoddard's beautiflly built [Grease](https://github.com/adamstddrd/grease).

**Sara brings thematic Joy.** After lots of hard work, [Sara Joy](https://sarajoy.dev/) has launched [11ty Themes Joy](https://11tytheme.sjoy.lol/), an Eleventy-based theme sampling site. Sara has taken the Eleventy base blog (built on v3) and created a site where you can try out (as of now) a handful of different CSS-based themes for customizing the look of the site. She's also shares [instructions on how you can create your own theme](https://11tytheme.sjoy.lol/contributors/) and share those with the community. With more and more folks looking to get started with Eleventy, this is an excellent resource. Thank you, Sara!

**Meetup-Meetup-Meetup.** Don't miss [Episode 20 of the Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-20-music-trackers-and-social-share-images/) on October 23d, featuring [Cory Dransfeldt](https://coryd.dev/) sharing his music tracking techniques, and [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/) showing us how to generate social share images. I'll definitely be there! Hope you will be too!

**Building with fundamentals.** There's getting started with a starter, but then there's getting started with the fundamentals. [Blake Watson](https://blakewatson.com/) has built what many in the web development community are praising, and that is his new [HTML for People site/book](https://htmlforpeople.com/). While not 11ty-related, it's a great resource for those looking to learn how to build a site with HTML. Hats off to you, Blake!

**Horsing around with 11ty.** I love the old west style that the [Prairie Rose Arena](https://prairierosearena.com/) site displays. It was [built for his mom](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/notes/prairie-rose-arena-notes/) by one of the newest authors here, [Sam Feldstein](/authors/sam-feldstein/).

**Who says you can't rap to 11ty?** I stumbled across this 2-minute long "[old school rap teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hiUvyxRIOY)" about Eleventy. Enjoy!

Until next time...
