_Had a great time in New Jersey with friends and family...still recovering from excess food and drink. But...I'm back! And with v3 at our doorstep, I may have to go back to a weekly schedule...we'll see._

**Eleventy v3-beta.2: The Final Countdown.** [Eleventy v3.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.2) has hit the streets. This could be the final beta before the stable release. Click that link to see the release notes.

**v3 docs ready to roll.** Zach has been very busy adding v3 docs for various features. They include the following (and more):

- use of memoize with several built-in filters
- an update on content dates
- validating data
- ESM shown as default, with CJS alongside
- plugins can be async
- exposing universal filters and shortcodes in the config API
- better error messaging for permalinks lacking a trailing slash

There were links in the GitHub posts about these, but they'll be short-lived, so I won't provide them here. I can't wait to see v3 hit and the docs enter production. I just can't tell you when that's gonna happen. But it's coming.

This just in (Sep 30, 2024, 2:14pm Pacific Time): a massive pull request titled [v3.0.0 Stable Release Documentation](https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website/pull/1733) has been sighted.

**The Eleventy Meetup happened.** There were two great talks at the recent [Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-19-migrating-to-3-0-and-blogging-with-storyblok/). [Helen Chong](https://11tybundle.dev/authors/helen-chong/) described how she upgraded her site from v2 to v3. And [Estela Franco](https://11tybundle.dev/authors/estela-franco/) showed us how to use Storyblok with Eleventy. Be sure to sign up for [the newsletter](https://11tymeetup.dev/#newsletter) to be notified of upcoming events.

**Template syntax plugins released.** The [official template syntax plugins](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-template-languages) recently reached v1.0.0 status:

- EJS
- HAML
- Handlebars
- Mustache
- Pug

**Migrating from Wordpress to Eleventy.** For some reason, people might be looking for ways to migrate their Wordpress sites to Eleventy. I won't get into these "[reasons](https://css-tricks.com/catching-up-on-the-wordpress-wp-engine-sitch/)," but for those interested, [Will Boyd](https://github.com/lonekorean) has a utility called [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) that might be of interest.

**How real Shopify sites perform.** [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/) built an Eleventy site showing how real Shopify sites perform. The site is called [Shopify Theme Vitals](https://themevitals.com/). If you or your clients run a Shopify site, there might be some good learnings here.

**Connecting Notion to Eleventy.** [Stefan Brechb√ºhl](https://stebre.ch/), who I just came across, has a plugin and blog post on [connecting Notion to Eleventy](https://11tybundle.dev/authors/stefan-brechbuhl/). They're from earlier this year, but I've just uncovered them.

**Fursuiting is a thing.** [BristolFurs](https://bristolfurs.co.uk/) is one of the recent sites built with Eleventy. I was not aware that Fursuiting was a thing. But it is. And this site is a thing. And it's built with Eleventy.

Until next time...
