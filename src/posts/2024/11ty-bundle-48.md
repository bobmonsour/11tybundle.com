**We're up to v3.0.0-alpha.13!** Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.13). alpha.12 came out to just before alpha.13. See its [release notes](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.12).

**Getting started made easier.** Windows and some other platforms can get funky when it comes to the command line. As I understand it, there are several different, yet not quite compatible, terminal options from which to choose. And it seems that people have run into trouble when trying to follow the Eleventy Quick Start guide. So, Zach has added some platform-specific instructions to help. He described it in one of the GitHub issue comments [here](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/2082#issuecomment-2168828502). And you can see that now in the [Quick Start](https://www.11ty.dev/).

**Deep dive posts by Jonathan Lau.** Jonathan is a new discovery and he goes incredibly deep into a couple of topics. Check out [his posts](/authors/jonathan-lau/). Here's a direct link to one of them: [creating an interactive table of contents from markdown-generated content](https://blog.jonathanlau.io/posts/create-interactive-toc-in-markdown-generated-content/).

**MDX is now a supported template language.** For the uninitiated, like me, MDX is an extension to Markdown that lets you include JSX in Markdown documents (I doubt I'll ever be doing that. To each, his own.). Find info about it [here in the Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/mdx/).

**A new 'Upgrading' category.** Several people have been writing things about upgrading to v3. I've created a new category called [Upgrading](/categories/upgrading/) to collect these posts. It does include some posts about upgrading to 2.0, and even 1.0. They're included for completeness.

Until next time...
