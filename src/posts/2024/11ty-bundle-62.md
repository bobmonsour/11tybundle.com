**_Some notes from Bob:_**

I'm utterly noteless this week.

---

**Raymond's video series.** [Raymond Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com/), the author with the [most posts on this site](/authors/raymond-camden/) (103 as of this writing) has a [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5lfwd5KScM#t=14m47s) [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY9B90-nmgk) video series titled _"Let's Build a blog Like it's 1990."_ If you're wanting to build a blog with with Eleventy, this is a great place to start.

**Build an image gallery.** [Nathan Upchurch](https://nathanupchurch.com/) shows us how be [built an image gallery](https://nathanupchurch.com/blog/galleries/) with Eleventy. And he shares a demo with [Pop Tart Flavor Memes](https://nathanupchurch.com/gallery/pop-tart-flavor-memes/). Nathan's post joins the others in the [image galleries category](/categories/image-galleries/).

**Equilibrium in the UK.** One thing I love about the RSS reader that I use, [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/), is that it uncovers feeds that I am not even following, using its 'Monitoring feeds' feature. It monitors various sites in its universe and captures those that have user-defined keywords. This week, I was thrilled to uncover a significant author of Eleventy content. He goes by the handle _'equilibriumuk'_. You can find [his website here](https://equk.co.uk/) and the [list of his Eleventy posts here](/authors/equilibriumuk/).

**11ty at the Louvre.** This just in, here are two pages at the website of the Louvre museum in Paris that are built with Eleventy. Here's the [top-level books page](https://livres.louvre.fr/) and one of the [pages for a specific book](https://livres.louvre.fr/steles-puniques-carthage/). Who said Eleventy wasn't culturally appropriate?

**Eleventy versions.** The exceptionally helpful Discord user, known as _'vrugtehagel,'_ shared an observation that I was unaware of. In the top navigation of the [Eleventy website](https://www.11ty.dev/), there's a dropdown menu showing all of the Eleventy versions, titled _"Versions."_ Not sure if this is new or if I just missed it. But it's kinda cool to see.

**Autofocus in the search?** I have turned on the autofocus option in the Pagefind search that I use here. What that means is that when you land on any page of the site, all of which contain the search box at the top, your cursor will be pre-positioned in the search box. It seems that a large majority of visitors to the site enter on the home page. I am making the assumption that they've come to search. So rather than having to move your cursor to the search box, it's already there. I'm curious to know if you think this is a good idea or not. I do realize that this may pose an accessibility problem for some. I'd welcome any thoughts on this, [via email](mailto:bob.monsour@gmail.com?subject=Comment:%20Autofocus).

Until next time...
