## A new mascot for Eleventy

Say hello to [our new little friend](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/mascot-david/), created by David Neal, a very talented artist and long-time Eleventy enthusiast. If you have ideas for its name, please share them on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy).

## Another free hosting option

Kinsta, a hosting platform for web apps and sites has announced a free tier for hosting static sites, including support for Eleventy. According to [the page describing the features](https://kinsta.com/static-site-hosting/), you can have up to 100 sites, 600 build minutes, and 100GB bandwidth per month per account, and automatic deploys based on pushes to your repositories. I have no dog in this fight, but wanted to share this announcement.

## A new front matter option

In the upcoming 3.0 release, there will be a new feature that will be familar to folks using WebC. You can use arbitrary JavaScript in your front matter. You can read more about it in [this GitHub discussion thread](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/2819).

Until next time...
